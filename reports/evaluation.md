To estimate the model’s effectiveness in a real reCAPTCHA test scenario (where the system presents a grid of images containing zero or more target objects), we calculated the probability of the model correctly solving the (3x3) grid for different numbers of targets (M). These probabilities are based on the model’s per-image performance metrics (accuracy and recall) derived from the confusion matrix obtained on the test set.

Specifically, we used the model’s True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) from the confusion matrix to simulate the model’s behavior on a hypothetical reCAPTCHA grid. For each grid size (different numbers of target images), we estimated the probability that the model correctly identifies all target images (marks all target images as positive) and avoids selecting any incorrect images (does not select non-target images).

The results are:

| Number of targets (M) | Probability of solving the grid (P_solve) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|         0             |                  61.84%                   |
|         1             |                  28.18%                   |
|         2             |                  12.84%                   |
|         3             |                  5.85%                    |
|         4             |                  2.67%                    |
|         5             |                  1.22%                    |


These results were obtained by first getting the overall True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate of the model, from the tpr_tnr.py script, and then plugging them in the functions that computed these probabilities in the recaptcha_success.py script.

**Interpretation:**

M = 0: When there are no target images, the model has a 61.84% chance of correctly identifying this by selecting no images at all (not making any false positives).

M = 1: When there is exactly one target image, the model has a 28.18% chance of selecting the correct image while avoiding false positives.

M = 2-5: As the number of target images increases, the probability that the model correctly selects all targets (without selecting any incorrect images) decreases sharply. For instance, with 3 targets, the probability drops to just 5.85%.

Overall, when considering the distribution of different target counts in typical reCAPTCHA grids, the expected solve rate is **17.46%**. This means that, on average, the model will successfully pass the reCAPTCHA test only about 1 in every 6 attempts.

**Key Takeaways:**

The model performs relatively well at avoiding false positives (good specificity) but struggles to consistently identify all targets when multiple targets are present (lower sensitivity).

The low overall expected solve rate indicates that the current model is not yet reliable enough to consistently pass real reCAPTCHA challenges.

Future improvements could focus on increasing the model’s recall (True Positive Rate) and better handling of multi-target grids.
