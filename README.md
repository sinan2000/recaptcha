# reCAPTCHA Solver 🛠️

This project is part of the **[Applied Machine Learning](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBAI065-05#WBAI065-05.2024-2025.1)** course at the **University of Groningen**, developed by **Group 23**. Our project goal is to build an AI system that is able to automatically solve reCAPTCHA tests through **image classification techniques**.

Before getting started with our project, we encourage you to carefully read the sections below.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Pipenv**: Pipenv is used for dependency management. This tool enables users to easily create and manage virtual environments. To install Pipenv, use the following command:
    ```bash
    $ pip install --user pipenv
    ```
    For detailed installation instructions, [click here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Getting Started
### Setting up the repository

If you're collaborating or want to explore the latest version of the project:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Configure a remote pointing to the upstream repository to sync changes between your fork and the original repository.
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sinan2000/recaptcha
   ```
   **Don't skip this step.** We might update the original repository, so you should be able to easily pull our changes.
   
   To update your forked repo follow these steps:
   1. `git fetch upstream`
   2. `git rebase upstream/main`
   3. `git push origin main`
      Sometimes you may need to use git push --force origin main. Only use this flag the first time you push after you rebased, and be careful as you might overwrite someone' changes.

## Installing Dependencies
To install the project dependencies run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This will automatically create a virtual environment.

To **activate** the virtual environment, run:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

To **deactivate** the virtual environment, run:

```bash
exit
```

## Testing
You can run all the unit and integration tests which use the standard _unittest_ Python module with the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
If you wish to see additional details, run it in verbose mode:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -v tests
```

## Repository Structure

**API Launching 🚀**
To start the FastAPI server locally, follow these steps:

1. Activate pipenv environment (if not already activated)

```bash
pipenv shell
```

2. You can start the FastAPI server using:

```bash
uvicorn recaptcha_classifier.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Alternatively, run the API by running main.py:

Make sure the open_api() function is uncommented in main.py

```python
def main():
    # train_main_classifier()
    open_api()  # ✅ Uncomment this line
```

3. After running the server, you can access:
Interactive API docs (Swagger UI): 
ReDoc documentation:

These interfaces allow you to test predictions and inspect the request/response formats.
